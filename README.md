## 🧠 Overview  

**[Model Name]** is a machine learning model designed for **[insert general purpose, e.g., spatiotemporal forecasting, anomaly detection, etc.]**. It solves **[list tasks, e.g., regression and classification]** and provides **[specific features, e.g., uncertainty quantification, scalable design, etc.]**.

**Key Capabilities**:  
- **Probabilistic Outputs**: [Brief description of output style].  
- **Learning Approach**: [Insert core learning mechanism like CNNs, LSTMs, etc.].  
- **Integration-Ready**: Built to seamlessly integrate into the larger **VIEWS Pipeline**.  

---

## 🌍 Role in the VIEWS Pipeline  

[Model Name] serves as part of the **Violence & Impacts Early Warning System (VIEWS)** pipeline. It complements the following repositories:  

- **[views-pipeline-core](https://github.com/views-platform/views-pipeline-core):** For data ingestion and preprocessing.  
- **[views-models](https://github.com/views-platform/views-models):** Handles training, testing, and deployment.  
- **[views-evaluation](https://github.com/views-platform/views-evaluation):** Evaluates and calibrates model outputs.  
- **[docs](https://github.com/views-platform/docs):** Organization/pipeline level documentation.


### Integration Workflow  

[Model Name] fits into the pipeline as follows:  
1. **Data Input:** Processes preprocessed data from **views-pipeline-core**.  
2. **Model Execution:** [Describe model's role, e.g., generating forecasts, identifying anomalies].  
3. **Post-Processing:** Outputs are sent to **views-evaluation** for further analysis.

## ⚙️ Installation  

### Prerequisites  

- Python >= 3.8  
- GPU support recommended (e.g., NVIDIA CUDA).  
- Access to **views-pipeline-core** for data preprocessing.  

### Steps  

See the organization/pipeline level [docs](https://github.com/views-platform/docs)  


---

## 🚀 Usage  

### 1. Run Training Locally  

See the organization/pipeline level [docs](https://github.com/views-platform/docs)  

### 2. Use in the VIEWS Pipeline  

[Model Name] integrates seamlessly with the VIEWS pipeline. After processing, outputs can be passed to **views-evaluation** for further calibration or ensembling.

## 🏗 Architecture  

[Provide a high-level overview of the architecture. Include placeholders for key components.]  

### Key Components  

- **[Component 1]:** [e.g., CNNs for spatial dependencies].  
- **[Component 2]:** [e.g., LSTMs for temporal learning].  
- **[Component 3]:** [e.g., dropout layers for uncertainty quantification].  

### Workflow  

1. **Input:** [Describe input requirements, e.g., historical conflict data].  
2. **Processing:** [Describe the data transformations applied].  
3. **Prediction:** [Describe output, e.g., regression or classification predictions].  

Refer to the **[Model Paper/Docs](link-to-paper-or-docs)** for an in-depth explanation.
